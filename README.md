# OTAUpdates


A useful tool to help ROM developers provide OTA updates to their users. It's free to use, you can build from source or use the APK provided.

# Requirements


1. Root - Not essential, but you will most likely have this anyway
2. A place to store a static manifest XML
3. A place to host your ROM
4. Some build.prop entries

# Building or Downloading
## Downloading

You can get the latest version of the APK [here](http://ultimarom.com/ota-updates/).

## Eclipse

To build from source via Eclipse, you need to checkout the [instructions on building](Building.md)

## AOSP

To build from source in your AOSP build, you need to checkout the [instructions on building with AOSP](AOSP_CM.md). There are some advantages of this method, being that this method does not need root/SU permissions throughout the app.

# Using

There are two ways you can use this in your ROM. Manually, or automatically with [romhut.com](https://www.romhut.com). 

RomHut is highly recommended, as it will host your files for you, automate the process somewhat and it's free for users and developers:
- [Using with romhut.com](RomHut.md)
- [Using manually](Manually.md)

# Installing

Be aware, this application is meant for ROM developers. If you are a user wishing to use this application, get in touch with your developer and point them towards this page!

For ROM developers, [see here for installing instructions](Installing.md)

# Usage

Anyone is free to use this project in their ROM. I only request that you keep the about page in-tact leaving my credits in there. You don't have to, but it'd be nice if you did.

I'd also appreciate a tag in your post, wherever you publish :)
